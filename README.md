# SLAM-Data-Analysis

Analysis files for SLAM project--details about the project can be found here: https://slam.uconn.edu


**TASKS:**
  - Count (asking participants to recite count list, if they have one)
  - Count Objects (asking participants to count objects, tests counting principles)
  - Give-N (Give a number task, measure of number cognition, specifically exact quantity representation)
  - PPVT (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Task, general measure of language--VOCAB)
  - Panamath (computer program/game allowing estimation of approximate number system--AKA analogue magnitude system)
  - OTHERS (coming soon)

**PARTICIPANT DATA:**
  - Age at Test
  - Language Group (4 cat) - English-Early, ASL-Early, English-Late, ASL-Late
  - Language Group (2 cat) - Early, Late (collapses modality from above group)
  - SES (family filled out background questionnaire)

**PRIMARY QUESTIONS WE ASK:**
  - Does modality of language influence the development of number cognition?
  - Does timing of language exposure influence the development of number cognition?
  - Are these effects different for different tasks (those that get at different aspects of number cognition)
  
**SECONDARY QUESTIONS:**
  - How does performance on some tasks (e.g. Panamath) influence performance on others?
  - Does timing of language exposure affect vocabulary knowledge?
  - Validating American Sign Language (ASL) translation of PPVT
